CakeBash Project Setup
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Django
MySQL


Step-by-Step Setup
1. Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine and navigate to the project directory:

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CakeBash.git
cd CakeBash

2. Create a Virtual Environment
It's a good practice to use a virtual environment for your Python projects:

bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`

3. Install Dependencies
Install the required Python packages using pip:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Setup the Database
4.1. Install MySQL
Ensure you have MySQL installed on your system. You can download it from the MySQL official website.

4.2. Create the Database and Import Data
Open Command Prompt and navigate to the project directory:

bash
cd path\to\your\project\CakeBash
Run the setup script:

bash
python setup_db.py
This script will:

Create a database named cake.
Import the data from cakebash_dump.sql into the cake database.
You will be prompted to enter your MySQL root password during this process.

Note: Ensure that the cakebash_dump.sql file is located in the root directory of your project (same directory as manage.py).

5. Configure Django Settings
Update the DATABASES setting in my_django_project/settings.py to match your MySQL configuration:

python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
        'NAME': 'cakebash',
        'USER': 'your_mysql_user',          #Replace 'your_mysql_user' with your_mysql_user Usually 'root'
        'PASSWORD': 'your_mysql_password',  #Replace 'your_mysql_user' with your_mysql_passwowrd
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'PORT': '3306',
    }
}
Replace your_mysql_user and your_mysql_password with your actual MySQL username and password.

6. Run Django Migrations (if necessary)
bash
python manage.py migrate


7. Start the Development Server
bash
python manage.py runserver
You should now have the project up and running with the pre-populated database.
